# Insightly

## Inspiration
We are a group of students who believe that we can have a positive impact in the community around us, especially with the help of research. However, it's hard for us to get insight on published research papers because they are very long and time-consuming to find. This inspired us to create Insightly, a synchronized web platform where we can effectively analyze research papers and understand key points. 

## What it does
Insightly is a productive tool that is used to efficiently examine research papers, without needing to read through the entire paper. It streamlines easy access to published papers and significantly reduces researching time. With this platform, the user can: 
- View summaries of the research paper(s)
- Find tagged topic headers for the paper
- Get more info on research topics through Q&A
- See similar paper recommendations

## How we built it
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Python
- User login/authentication: Google Firebase

## Best domain from domain.com
https://insight-research.tech

## Most Creative Use of GitHub
We are using GitHub for the following reasons:
- Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- GitHub Project: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- Deploying the project: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.

## Challenges we ran into
- We had to brainstorm and come up with a feasible idea that was innovative and could be implemented within the given time frame.
- We tried to get a few more teammates to join us so we could split the work evenly, but no luck
- Due to the difference in the time zone, we had some difficulty collaborating, but we managed to get the project done.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing the project under the given time frame.
- Implementing a functioning backend and frontend
- Using an aesthetically pleasing UI
- Building a great website that is user-friendly and adheres to the theme

## What we learned
- Collaboration with other developers
- Efficient time management

## What's next for Insightly
- Building a mobile app
- Adding more features such as highlighting text, etc. 
- Gathering more relevant data and using accurate ML for user optimization
- Improving the UI
