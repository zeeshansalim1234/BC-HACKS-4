## Inspiration üí°
No matter what career field you‚Äôre in or how high up you are, **there‚Äôs always more to learn**. Research **unlocks the unknowns**, lets you explore the world from **different perspectives**, and fuels a deeper understanding. Reports state that *90% of ideas fail because of lack of research and proper background study*. Nowadays for most researchers in academia, reading through different papers has become a *hassle*. However, it's hard for us to get insight on the same because they are *very long* and *time-consuming* to find. This inspired us to create **Insightly**, a smart webapp where one can effectively analyze research papers and understand key points packed with multiple other AI-based features which you'll follow through the post.

**But wait? why ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù?**

*Research* is prettymuch the *base of every hackathon project* that one has ever done & will do. But apart from this, let‚Äôs discuss the *top 10* points for why one should do research.

- 1. Research expands your knowledge base.
- 2. Research gives you the latest information.
- 3. Research helps you know what you‚Äôre up against.
- 4. Research builds your credibility.
- 5. Research helps you narrow your scope.
- 6. Research teaches you better discernment.
- 7. Research introduces you to new ideas.
- 8. Research helps with problem-solving.
- 9. Research helps you reach people.
- 10. Research encourages curiosity.


## What it does ü§î
Insightly is a **productive tool** that is used to efficiently *examine research papers*, without needing to read through the entire paper. It streamlines easy access to published papers and significantly reduces researching time. With this platform, the user can:

- View summaries of the research paper(s)
- Find tagged topic headers for the paper
- Get more info on research topics through Q&A
- Get sentiment status of the topic
- See similar paper recommendations
- Personalized Profiling

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è
**Insightly** is crafted with üíô. We went with a minimalist approach by building the front-end with *HTM*L, *CSS* & *Vanilla Javascript*. After OAuth-ing with *Firebase*, we land on the homepage, where we can leverage a bunch of useful tools according to our needs.

We can upload our own pdf document or can search through papers available on ArXiv or via custom URL. Once we do that we have the option to generate total or partial summary of the selected which is powered by our own Custom Trained Superfast Machine Learning model. Moreover, we can also analyze the sentiment of the same if we require. Furthermore, using *BigBERT* we are also able to resolve any sort of questions taken as an input promt to return accurate answers. The backing is running on splitted pipelines of *Pytorch* with *OnnX*. And last but not least, all these datas shall be stored in the user dashboard utilizing which, the machine can automatically recommend more similar papers via *cosine similarity*.

## Best domain from domain.com üåê
‚Üí **https://insight-research.tech/**

## Most Creative Use of GitHub üîù
We are using GitHub for the following reasons:
- Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- GitHub Project: We also used GitHub for planning and keeping track of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- Deploying the project: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.

## Challenges we ran into üò§
- We had to brainstorm and come up with a feasible idea that was innovative and could be implemented within the given time frame.
- We tried to get a few more teammates to join us so we could split the work evenly, but no luck
- Due to the difference in the time zone, we had some difficulty collaborating, but we managed to get the project done.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ‚ú®
- Shipping fully-functioning project under the given time frame.
- Implementing a functioning backend and frontend.
- Using an aesthetically pleasing UI.
- Building a great user-friendly interface that adheres to the theme.

## What we learned üôå
- Collaboration with other developers
- Efficient time management

## What's next for Insightly üöÄ
- Building a mobile app
- Adding more features such as selective-highlighting, native-translation, etc. 
- Gathering more relevant data and using accurate ML for user optimization
- Improving the UI
